        This MPI program uses a master-worker communication model. 
    Each of five processes holds a number from a fixed array. Worker processes 
    (ranks 1â€“4) determine if their number is out of order (read: less than the
    number held by their left-hand neighbour) and report this to the master 
    process (rank 0).

    // use its rank to pull its number from the array
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 5, 15, 25};
    int myNumber; // this will hold the number for current process

    // This will hold the value for left process
