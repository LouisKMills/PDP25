        This MPI program uses a master-worker communication model. 
    Each of five processes holds a number from a fixed array. Worker processes 
    (ranks 1â€“4) determine if their number is out of order (read: less than the
    number held by their left-hand neighbour) and report this to the master 
    process (rank 0).
